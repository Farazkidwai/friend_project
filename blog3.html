<h2><u> 14.Facebook News Blackout: Australia Won’t Change Planned Content Law Despite Block  </u></h2><br>

Australia will not change proposed laws that would make Alphabet's Google and Facebook pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, despite vocal opposition from the Big Tech firms.
<br><br>
Facebook has strongly protested the laws and last week abruptly blocked all news content and several state government and emergency department accounts. The social media giant and Australian leaders continued discussing the changes over the weekend.
<br><br>
But with the bill scheduled for a debate in the Senate on Monday, Australia's most senior lawmaker in the upper house said there would be no further amendments.<br><br><br>

<h2><u> 15.Facebook Starts Blocking Sensitive Medical Data Shared by Apps Over Privacy Concerns  </u></h2><br>
<img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/facebook_3d_print_reuters_1608098859091.jpg?downsize=950:*&output-quality=80&output-format=webp" height="600" width="1000" ><br>
<p><h3><header>
Facebook has started blocking sensitive health information that third-party apps had been sharing with the social network in violation of its own rules, said New York officials who investigated the situation.
<br><br>
Data fed into a Facebook analytics tool by app makers included medical diagnoses and whether users were pregnant, according to a report shared by New York financial services department on Thursday.
<br><br>
"Facebook instructed app developers and websites not to share medical, financial, and other sensitive personal consumer data but took no steps to police this rule," state financial services superintendent Linda Lacewell said in a release.
<br><br>
"By continuing to do business with app developers that broke the rule, Facebook put itself in a position to profit from sensitive data that it was never supposed to receive in the first place."
<br><br>
User information from apps is regularly shared with Facebook through a tool that offers developers free analysis of data to help guide improvements to apps, according to the investigation launched last year.
<br><Br>
"Our policies prohibit sharing sensitive health information and it's not something we want," a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to an AFP inquiry.<br><br><br>

<h2><u> 16.Netflix Can Now Automatically Download Movies and TV Shows for You  </u></h2><br>
<img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/netflix_downloads_for_you_1613993395440.jpg?downsize=950:*&output-quality=80&output-format=webp" height="600" width="1000" ><br>

Netflix's Smart Downloads feature is broadening its horizons with “Downloads for You.” It can now automatically download movies and TV shows that you might like, to help you in situations where you find yourself stuck without Internet access or in a long wait like the evening commute. (Remember travelling to and fro for work? Saving on commute time is one of the few things I'm grateful to COVID-19 for.) Previously, Netflix's Smart Downloads would automatically delete the episodes you've watched and download the next episode of said TV series. But movies (or new shows) were out of the question. With Downloads for You, Netflix goes a step further.
<br><br>
How to automatically download movies and TV shows on Netflix app
Naturally, Netflix's Downloads for You is an opt-in feature that you can turn on inside the Netflix app. The feature is only available for Android devices, it's not on iPhone and iPad right now.
<br><br>
1. To get started, simply launch the Netflix Android app.
2. Then, tap on the Downloads tab.
3. There, hit the toggle next to Downloads for You.
4. On the next screen, decide how much storage space you want to dedicate for Downloads for You. Netflix says     3GB is enough for 12 movies and TV shows.
5. Once you've made up your mind, tap Turn On.
<br><br>
If you change your mind, you can always deactivate the Downloads for You toggle in the Netflix app. Or if you run into storage troubles, you can decrease the amount it takes up from Downloads > Smart Downloads. Alternatively, if you want more surprises, just increase the storage space allotted to Downloads for You. The storage space you reserve for automatic downloads will not be used by manual downloads you initiate in the Netflix app.
<br><br>
“Three years ago, we introduced Smart Downloads so you can find the next episode of your favorite show — even when you're on the go,” Netflix's director of product innovation Patrick Flemming wrote in a Netflix blog. “Now, we want to make discovering your next new favorite series or film quick and easy whether you're connected or not. Today we're launching Downloads for You, a new feature that automatically downloads recommended shows or movies to your mobile device based on your tastes.”
<br><br>
Netflix's Downloads for You is available now on Android globally. It will soon enter testing on iOS. If you're wondering how much of a wait it might be, Netflix's Smart Downloads feature took nearly seven months to make the jump from Android to iOS.<br><br><br>

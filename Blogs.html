<p><h3><header>
You&#8217;re not looking at an image from Blade Runner 2049, just the San Francisco sky on Wednesday. This apocalyptic color comes<br> from smoke particles caused by the burning wildfires across the state. Many people flew drones through the skyline, but the smoke<br>isso thick, you&#8217;d think a fire was actually burning close to San Francisco. However, the ash and smoke floating over the Bay Area <br> 	 Wednesday actually comes from the Bear Fire burning near Oroville, around 150 miles northeast of San Francisco.<br><br><br>
